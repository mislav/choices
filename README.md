The choice is yours
===================

Easy-peasy external settings for your Rails app.

    # Gemfile
    gem 'choices'

In your app initializer block:

    config.from_file 'settings.yml'
    
    #to scope out your settings
    # Rails.configuration.my_engine...
    config.from_file 'settings.yml', "my_engine"

This will read configuration from "config/settings.yml" and, additionally, "settings.local.yml" if it exists. You should check the main file into version control, but not the ".local" file which is to be used for per-machine configuration: tweaks in development or private keys in production, for example.

    # .gitignore
    config/settings.local.yml

Configuration files can contain ERB; this is useful for reading in Heroku configuration. For example:

    # settings.yml
    defaults: &defaults
      secret_token: <%= ENV['COOKIE_SECRET'] %>
      heroku: <%= !!ENV['HEROKU_TYPE'] %>
      mongodb:
        uri: <%= ENV['MONGOHQ_URL'] %>

    development:
      <<: *defaults

    test: &testing
      <<: *defaults
      secret_token: <%= "banana" * 5 %>
      mongodb:
        database: myapp_test

    cucumber:
      <<: *testing

The ".local" file can contain overrides for your development environment:

    # settings.local.yml
    development:
      mongodb:
        database: myapp_dev

Finally, the config keys can be read in your app as such:

    Rails.configuration.heroku              #=> false
    Rails.configuration.mongodb.database    #=> "myapp_dev"
